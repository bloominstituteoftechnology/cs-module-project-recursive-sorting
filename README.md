# Module Project - Recursive Sorting

## Algorithms

## Recursive Sorting

## Objectives

- identify when a problem is amenable to a recursive solution and use recursion to solve it
- trace and accurately identify the output of a recursive function call
- write a recursive solution to a problem
- distinguish when to use, classify the performance, and implement code to conduct classic recursive sorting algorithms

## Introduction

During today's project, you will get a chance to practice the module's objectives. You will be required to write a recursive merge sort algorithm. Knowing when to and how to use recursion will make you a better programmer and developer. It will give you one more tool in your toolbag whenever you face a problem that you need to solve.

When you begin interviewing for jobs, you will often encounter problems that have elegant recursive solutions. Being comfortable with recursion and understanding how recursion works at a deep level is essential in ensuring you are ready to impress hiring managers and (ultimately) can contribute to an engineering team in a significant way.

## FAQs

### How do you assess space complexity?

Generally speaking, at work and in interviews, people are more interested in
time complexity. That said, _space complexity_, or how much additional space is
required to process _n_ elements of data, is also very important.

Space complexity does _not_ include the space required to hold the data you are
going to process. It only includes the _additional_ space requirements of your
algorithm.

Here's an example with `O(1)` space requirements:

```python
def alg(data):
    result = 0

    for v in data:
        result += v

    return result
```

Clearly the _time_ complexity is `O(n)`. As list `data` grows, the time it takes
to complete the algorithm grows proportionately.

But the _space_ complexity is `O(1)`. The additional space required to complete
the algorithm was:

* `result`: `O(1)`
* `v`: `O(1)`

And neither of those change in size regardless of how big list `data` is. `data`
could have a zillion elements, and the algorithm would still only require space
for `result` and `v`.

What about this:

```python
def alg(data):
    new_data = data.copy()   # <-- Added this line

    result = 0

    for v in new_data:
        result += v

    return result
```

Here we have more space allocated.

* `result`: `O(1)`
* `v`: `O(1)`
* `new_data`: `O(n)`

`new_data` gets bigger as `data` gets bigger, so it's `O(n)`. So we have:

`O(1) + O(1) + O(n)` space requirements. `O(n)` dominates, so the final result
is `O(n)`.

Where things get really tricky is when you have a recursive call. Each call to
the function allocates space for all the local variables.

And it gets doubly tricky if you're making a copy of the data each call, like
with a slice.

Here's the same algorithm as before that adds all the elements in a list, except
this one does it recursively. Recall that the initial iterative version was
`O(1)` space complexity.

```python
def alg(data):
    if data == []:
        return 0

    first_val = data[0]

    return first_val + alg(data[1:])
```

Every time we make a call into `alg()`, we get new space for local variables. So
any local variable that was `O(1)` on its own, now gets _n_ copies and becomes
`O(1*n)` or `O(n)`.

But that's not all. When we slice `data` on the recursive call, we get a new
list. So that means every call we're getting another copy of the list, and each
copy is `O(n)` space as well. And we're making _n_ recursive calls, so we need
_n_ copies of `O(n)` space, which comes to `O(n*n)` or `O(n^2)` space.

> Sure, it's not a _complete_ copy of the list. It's missing the first element.

So we have _n_ recursive calls.

`first_val` on its own is `O(1)`. But we recurse _n_ times, so it becomes
`O(1*n)` or just `O(n)`.

Each slice of `data` on its own is `O(n)`. But we recurse _n_ times, so it
becomes `O(n*n)` or `O(n^2)`.

So the total space complexity for this algorithm is:

`O(n) + O(n^2)`. The `O(n^2)` dominates, so the final space complexity is just
`O(n^2)`.

Again, compare to the `O(1)` space complexity of the initial iterative solution.

In some languages, notably
[Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)) and other
[functional programming
languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming), you can write
recursive solutions with `O(1)` space complexity. These languages take advantage
of a feature known as [_tail call
optimization_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call) to make this possible.
By coding things correctly, the language can automatically convert your
recursive solution into an iterative solution. Stock C and Python do not support
tail call optimization.

### Both promises and recursion wait for something to resolve. Are they related?

Not really, though they are similar in that particular way.

Promises do wait for things to resolve before continuing, which is their primary
purpose of existence.

Recursion does much more, however. It's great for solving problems that can be
split into identical subproblems. It can also be used to replace any looping
construct.

### Should we use a language's built-in functionality as much as possible?

Yes.

Generally the built-in functionality is better tested and better optimized than
something you could write.

That said, there might be times you want to write your own versions. Maybe the
built-in doesn't do exactly what you need. Or maybe you want to rewrite the
built-in as a learning exercise, for example.

### What are the tradeoffs with in-place versus non-in-place sorting solutions?

Memory: in-place typically takes less memory since you're reusing the original
storage for the list to hold the finally sorted list. If you allocate more lists
to hold the result, that takes more memory.

Code clarity: in-place sometimes has more complex code making the algorithm
harder to understand.

As an example, here's a non-in-place Quicksort, which seems to be generally
clearer than the in-place variant, but uses far more memory:

```python
def partition(data):
    left = []
    pivot = data[0]
    right = []

    for v in data[1:]:
        if v <= pivot:
            left.append(v)
        else:
            right.append(v)

    return left, pivot, right

def quicksort(data):
    if data == []:
        return data

    left, pivot, right = partition(data)

    return quicksort(left) + [pivot] + quicksort(right)
```

### How do you keep track of recursion in your head?

One of the main tricks is to _not_ try to follow the flow of the code.

This is counterintuitive, because you're used to reading code and "running" it
mentally to follow what it does.

Unfortunately, with recursion, keeping track of all the calls and returns
quickly gets out of hand and human brains can't handle it. Computers are fine,
but people, not so much.

A better approach is to see how you're using recursion and try to model it in
your head a different way.

Commonly, recursion is used to break a problem up into identical, smaller
subproblems.

For example, the Fibonacci sequence is:

```
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 ...
```

where each number is the sum of the previous two numbers. And the _0th_ number
is defined to be `0`, and the _1st_ number is defined to be `1`.

We can write that mathematically like so:

```
fib(0) = 0
fib(1) = 1
fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```

But look there: it's a recursive definition! That last line of math says "the
_nth_ Fibonacci number is defined to be the sum of the two previous Fibonacci
numbers", just like the original definition of the sequence, we gave above.

Don't think of it as something that spirals off into an infinity of calls. Just
think of it as "any Fibonacci number is the sum of the previous two", and leave
it at that.

And that translates to code pretty easily:

```python
def fib(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0

    if n == 1:
        return 1

    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
```

(Note that the above naive solution runs in `O(2^n)` time. You can get it down
to `O(n)` using [_dynamic
programming_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming#Computer_programming).)
