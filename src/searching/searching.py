# TO-DO: Implement a recursive implementation of binary search
def binary_search(arr, target, low, high):
    if high >= low: # "loop" if high is greater than or equal to low (checking base case)
        mid = (high + low) // 2 # then declare a mid point for now
        if arr[mid] > target: # If element is greater than mid, then it's in the left subarray
            return binary_search(arr, target, low, mid - 1) # recurse, towards base case
        elif arr[mid] < target: # If element is less than mid, then it's in the right subarray
            return binary_search(arr, target, mid + 1, high) # recurse, towards base case
        elif arr[mid] == target: # If element is the target
            return mid # then do not recurse, simply return that element
    return -1 # not found (target was not in the list)

# STRETCH: implement an order-agnostic binary search
# This version of binary search should correctly find the target regardless
# of whether the input array is sorted in ascending order or in descending order
# You can implement this function either recursively or iteratively.
